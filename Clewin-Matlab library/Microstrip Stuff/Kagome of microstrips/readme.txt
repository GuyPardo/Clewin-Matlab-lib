Hierarchy:

Option 1:
First you make a Kagome_Piece: A resonator (strip), with a nanowire in each end.
Of three Kagome_Pieces you make a Kagome_triangle.
Of four Kagome_triangle elements, you make a Kagome_brick.
And finally, duplication of many Kagome_brick elements gives you the Kagome_lattice.

Option 2:
First you make a Kagome_Piece: A resonator (strip), with a nanowire in each end.
Of three Kagome_Pieces you make a Kagome_cross  - three of these coupled like in Houck's paper.
Finally, duplicate many Kagome_cross elements into a Kagome_Houck lattice
